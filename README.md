  ### Description
  This website is a note taker. It allows users to write their notes and give them a title, and to save their notes on the page. When they hit save, their note gets posted on the left side of the website, so they can then proceed in creating a new one. In order to open an old note, the user needs to click on it from the left side of the page, which brings it back to the right side. 

  This project uses the Express.js module in order to create `GET` and `POST` routes, as well as a `DELETE` route. The website is built using `HTML, CSS and JavaScript`. 

  This application is deployed with `Heroku`. 

  ### Installation

This will also install the random;hy generated IDs library, namely `uniqid`. After that, the dependencies will be installed and the user will have to type `node server.js` to start the server. Lastly, they will need to click on the localhost link that appears in the terminal, in order to be directed to the browser and use the website. 
  *All notes are saved on a `JSON file`, and when the user tries to add notes or remove one, his past notes will appear on the website.
